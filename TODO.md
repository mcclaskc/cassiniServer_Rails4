10 - Difficult, potentially months.
```
* custom 404 and 500 pages 
  * Backend difficulty: **2**
  * customization and styling could be as difficult and time intensive as desired
* Admin Login.  (Right now the data view/uploading is publicily accessible)
  * Difficulty: **3**   
* Interface with SPICE or other LASP data providers
  * Difficulty **5** - I don't know about SPICE, but most other API's that I have freshly interfaced with take about a week to polish up (Youtube, Facebook, Dropbox, etc).
* Web API method for events
  * Difficulty: **2** 
* Figure out a good way to make the Unity Web Player look nice on the site and be able to go fullscreen in the appropriate resolution. - Online documentation was unhelpful, my solution was to open a new page with nothing but the player at the biggest resolution the user's screen would allow.
  * Difficulty: **unknown**.
* Customize and improve the UI and styling in general.  I am not a front end guy at all, but I did my best to make it look somewhat ok. 
  * As much difficulty and time intensive as desired 
* Google Analytics
  * Difficulty: **1**

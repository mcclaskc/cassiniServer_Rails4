TODO
====

* custom 404 and 500 pages
* Admin Login.  (Right now the data view/uploading is publicily accessible)
* Interface with SPICE or other LASP data providers
* Web API method for events
* Figure out a good way to make the Unity Web Player look nice on the site and be able to go fullscreen in the appropriate resolution. - My solution was to open a new page with nothing but the player at the biggest resolution the user's screen would allow.
* Customize and improve the UI and styling in general.  I am not a front end guy at all, but I did my best to make it look somewhat ok. 
* Google Analytics
